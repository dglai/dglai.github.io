Since December 2019, the rapid spread of COVID-19 corona-viruses worldwide has
caused more than 7 million infections and more than 400,000 deaths. The rapid
spread of COVID-19 demonstrates the dire need for quick and effective drug
discovery. Drug repurposing is a drug discovery paradigm that uses existing
drugs for new therapeutic indications. It has the advantages of significantly
reducing time and cost relative to de novo drug discovery. Drug repurposing
with knowledge graphs presents a promising strategy for COVID-19 treatment.

A team of AWS scientists from Amazon Shanghai AI Lab and AWS Deep Engine
Science team working along with academic collaborators from the University of
Minnesota, The Ohio State University, and Hunan University have created the
**Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG)** and a set of machine learning tools
that can be used to prioritize drugs for repurposing studies. DRKG and the ML
tools are open sourced in github to help researchers conduct drug relocation
research on COVID-19 and other diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease).

DRKG is a comprehensive biological knowledge graph that relates human genes,
compounds, biological processes, drug side effects, diseases and symptoms. DRKG
includes, curates, and normalizes information from six publicly available
databases and data that were collected from recent publications related to
Covid-19. It has 97,238 entities belonging to 13 types of entities, and
5,874,261 triplets belonging to 107 types of relations.

The machine learning tools use DGL-KE to learn low dimension embedding
representations of entities and relations in DRKG. The resulting embeddings are
used to predict how likely a drug can treat a disease or how likely a drug can
bind to a protein associated with the disease. [DGL-KE](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke) is a high performance,
easy-to-use, and scalable package for learning large-scale knowledge graph
embeddings developed by Amazon Shanghai AI Lab. The package is implemented on
the top of Deep Graph Library (DGL) and developers can run DGL-KE on CPU
machine, GPU machine, as well as clusters with a set of popular models,
including TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE and etc. It can train a knowledge
graph consisting of over *86M* nodes and *338M* edges in 100 minutes on an EC2
instance with 8 GPUs and 30 minutes on an EC2 cluster with 4 machines.

DRKG github repository provides examples on using DGL-KE to [learn low
dimension embedding representations of entities and relations in
DRKG](https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG/blob/master/embedding_analysis/Train_embeddings.ipynb)
and using pre-trained knowledge graph embedding of DRKG to do [drug
repurposing](https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG/blob/master/drug_repurpose/COVID-19_drug_repurposing.ipynb).
Preliminary experimental results show that using certain machine learning tools
for COVID-19 drug discovery can identify a variety of drugs currently in
clinical trials with high ranking scores.

DRKG uses DGL-KE to learn knowledge graph embedding

*Step 1:* Downloading DRKG from [here](https://dgl-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dataset/DRKG/drkg.tar.gz)

*Step 2:* Load DRKG as follows.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(1, '../utils')
from utils import download_and_extract
download_and_extract()
drkg_file = '../data/drkg/drkg.tsv'
```

*Step 3:* DRKG data package has a drkg.tsv file containing all triplets in the
knowledge graph. Before training, We randomly divide the data set into training
set, validation set and test set according to the ratio of 0.9:0.05:0.05.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv(drkg_file, sep="\t")
triples = df.values.tolist()
seed = np.arange(num_triples)
np.random.shuffle(seed)

train_cnt = int(num_triples * 0.9)
valid_cnt = int(num_triples * 0.05)
train_set = seed[:train_cnt]
train_set = train_set.tolist()
valid_set = seed[train_cnt:train_cnt+valid_cnt].tolist()
test_set = seed[train_cnt+valid_cnt:].tolist()

with open("train/drkg_train.tsv", 'w+') as f:
   for idx in train_set:
       f.writelines("{}\t{}\t{}\n".format(triples[idx][0], triples[idx][1], triples[idx][2]))
      
with open("train/drkg_valid.tsv", 'w+') as f:
   for idx in valid_set:
       f.writelines("{}\t{}\t{}\n".format(triples[idx][0], triples[idx][1], triples[idx][2]))

with open("train/drkg_test.tsv", 'w+') as f:
   for idx in test_set:
       f.writelines("{}\t{}\t{}\n".format(triples[idx][0], triples[idx][1], triples[idx][2]))
```

*Step 4:* Then we directly invoke the command line toolkit provided by DGL-KE
to learn low dimension embedding representations of entities and relations in
DRKG. Here we choose the `TransE_l2` model and use an AWS p3.16xlarge instance to
train the model with multi-GPU in parallel. To use other KGE model or AWS
instances please refer to DGL-KE's [documentation](https://aws-dglke.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

```bash
DGLBACKEND=pytorch dglke_train --dataset DRKG --data_path ./train \
                               --data_files drkg_train.tsv drkg_valid.tsv drkg_test.tsv \
                               --format 'raw_udd_hrt' --model_name TransE_l2 --batch_size 2048 \
                               --neg_sample_size 256 --hidden_dim 400 --gamma 12.0 --lr 0.1 \
                               --max_step 100000 --log_interval 1000 --batch_size_eval 16 -adv \
                               --regularization_coef 1.00E-07 --test --num_thread 1 \
                               --gpu 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 --num_proc 8 \
                               --neg_sample_size_eval 10000 --async_update
```

*Step 5:* After training, two files are generated: 1)
`DRKG_TransE_l2_entity.npy`, containing the low dimension embedding
representations of entities in DRKG and 2) `DRKG_TransE_l2_relation.npy`,
containing the low dimension embeddings representations of relations in DRKG.
These embeddings can be used in drug repurposing tasks.

```python
node_emb = np.load('./ckpts/TransE_l2_DRKG_0/DRKG_TransE_l2_entity.npy')
relation_emb = np.load('./ckpts/TransE_l2_DRKG_0/DRKG_TransE_l2_relation.npy')
```

Use Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding for Repurposing Drugs for COVID-19
--- A collaboration work from Amazon AWS AI, Hunan University, Cleveland Clinic
Lerner Center for Genomic Medicine, and University of Minnesota (Repurpose Open
Data to Discover Therapeutics for COVID-19 using Deep Learning) proposed a new
drug repurposing methodology for COVID-19 using the combination of knowledge
graph embedding and gene-set enrichment analysis method. DRKG borrows the
similar idea and provides pre-trained knowledge graph embedding of DRKG for
drug repurposing for COVID-19.


First of all, we define the task of finding drugs for COVID-19 using DRKG
knowledge graph as a task of predicting the possible connections between
candidate drug entities and the COVID-19 related disease entities under the
relation of `'Hetionet::CtD::Compound:Disease'` and `'GNBR::T::Compound:Disease'`,
i.e. the treatment relationship. We select FDA approved drugs with molecular
weight larger than 250 from DRKG as drug candidates and use 34 COVID-19 virus
related entities in DRKG as target entities. Then we predict the connection
scores of all possible triplets (Drug, Treatment, Virus) under the `TransE_L2`
algorithm and sort the scores. Finally, we choose the top100 highest confident
connections and take the corresponding drugs as repurposed drugs. The detailed
steps are as following:

*Step 1:* Setting target virus entities, drug entities and treatment relations.

```python
# COVID-19 related virus entities
COV_disease_list = ['Disease::SARS-CoV2 E','Disease::SARS-CoV2 M', ...]

# treatment relations
treatment = ['Hetionet::CtD::Compound:Disease','GNBR::T::Compound:Disease']

# candidate drugs（provided in infer_drug.tsv along with the whole DRKG dataset)
drug_list = []
with open("./infer_drug.tsv", newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
   reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='\t', fieldnames=['drug','ids'])
   for row_val in reader:
       drug_list.append(row_val['drug'])
```

*Step 2:* Get the pretrained DRKG knowledge graph embedding.

```python
# Reading pretrained embeddings
entity_emb = np.load('../data/drkg/embed/DRKG_TransE_l2_entity.npy')
rel_emb = np.load('../data/drkg/embed/DRKG_TransE_l2_relation.npy')

drug_ids = th.tensor(drug_ids).long()
disease_ids = th.tensor(disease_ids).long()
treatment_rid = th.tensor(treatment_rid)

drug_emb = th.tensor(entity_emb[drug_ids])
treatment_embs = [th.tensor(rel_emb[rid]) for rid in treatment_rid]
```

*Step 3:* Predict the connection scores of all possible triplets (Drug, Treatment, Virus) under the `TransE_L2` algorithm，the formula is as following:

$$
\mathbf{d} = \gamma - ||\mathbf{h} + \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{t}||_2
$$

$$
\mathbf{score} = \log\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-\mathbf{d}}}\right)
$$

, where $$\mathbf{h}$$ is for head (i.e., drugs), $$\mathbf{r}$$ for relation, $$\mathbf{t}$$ for tail
(i.e., virus) and $$\gamma$$ is the constant value used in training.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as fn

gamma=12.0
def transE_l2(head, rel, tail):
   score = head + rel - tail
   return gamma - th.norm(score, p=2, dim=-1)

scores_per_disease = []
dids = []
# predict the connection scores of (Drug, Treatment, Virus) triplets 
# for each treatment type and combine them together.
for rid in range(len(treatment_embs)):
   treatment_emb=treatment_embs[rid]
   for disease_id in disease_ids:
       disease_emb = entity_emb[disease_id]
       score = fn.logsigmoid(transE_l2(drug_emb, treatment_emb, disease_emb))
       scores_per_disease.append(score)
       dids.append(drug_ids)
scores = th.cat(scores_per_disease)
```

*Step 4:* Sort the scores.

```python
idx = th.flip(th.argsort(scores), dims=[0])
scores = scores[idx].numpy()
dids = dids[idx].numpy()
```

*Step 5:* Get the top-100 repurposed drugs.

```python
topk=100
_, unique_indices = np.unique(dids, return_index=True)
topk_indices = np.sort(unique_indices)[:topk]
# top-100 drug Ids
proposed_dids = dids[topk_indices]
# top-100 drug scores
proposed_scores = scores[topk_indices]
```

*Step 6:* Six drugs in clinical trials appears in the top100 repurposed drugs. Their ranking and score is as following:

```
[0]    Ribavirin          -0.21416784822940826
[4]    Dexamethasone      -0.9984006881713867
[8]    Colchicine         -1.080674648284912
[16]   Methylprednisolone -1.1618402004241943
[49]   Oseltamivir        -1.3885014057159424
[87]   Deferoxamine       -1.513066053390503
```
