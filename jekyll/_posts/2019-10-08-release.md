Heterogeneous Graph Support
===

What is a heterogeneous graph?
---

A heterogeneous graph is a graph whose nodes and edges are typed:

Models that work on heterogeneous graphs?
---

Models using Heterogeneous Graph API:
* [GCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02263) [[Code in MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/mxnet/gcmc)]

  | Dataset | RMSE (DGL) | RMSE (Official) | Speed (DGL) | Speed (Official) | Speed Comparison |
  |---------|---------|---------|--------------|---------|-------------|
  | MovieLens-100K | **0.9077** | 0.910 | **0.0246s/epoch** | 0.1008s/epoch | 5x |
  | MovieLens-1M | 0.8377 | **0.832** | 0.0695s/epoch | 1.538s/epoch | 22x |
  | MovieLens-10M (full-graph training) | 0.7875 | **0.777** | 0.6480s/epoch | OOM | - |

* [R-GCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06103) [[Code in PyTorch](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/rgcn-hetero)]
  * We provide an R-GCN model for heterograph input. The new code can train the model for the AM dataset (>5M edges) using one GPU, while the original implementation can only run on CPU and consume 32GB memory.
  * The original implementation takes 51.88s to train one epoch on CPU. The new R-GCN based on heterograph takes only 0.1781s for one epoch on V100 GPU (**291x faster !!**).
* [Heterogeneous Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07293) [[Code in PyTorch](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/han)]
* [Metapath2vec](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098036) [[Code in PyTorch](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/metapath2vec)]
  * The metapath sampler is twice as fast as the original implementation.

How could I play with a heterogeneous graph?
---

Here is an example for creating and manipulating a heterogeneous graph:

```python
import dgl
import torch
import dgl.function as fn

g = dgl.heterograph({
    ('user', 'follows', 'user'): [(0, 1), (1, 2)],
    ('user', 'plays', 'game'): [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)],
    ('game', 'attracts', 'user'): [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)],
    ('developer', 'develops', 'game'): [(0, 0), (1, 1)],
    })

# Here the user nodes have a single feature named x, and game nodes have a single feature named y
x = torch.randn(3, 5)
y = torch.randn(2, 4)
g.nodes['user'].data['x'] = x
g.nodes['game'].data['y'] = y

# Edge features are similar
a = torch.randn(2, 5)
b = torch.randn(4, 7)
g.edges['follows'].data['a'] = a
g.edges['plays'].data['b'] = b

# One can also perform message passing.
# The following code performs a full message passing on the "plays" edges.
g['follows'].update_all(fn.copy_u('x', 'm'), fn.sum('m', 'z'))
z = g.nodes['game'].data['z']
assert torch.allclose(z[0], x[0])
assert torch.allclose(z[1], x[0] + x[1])
assert torch.allclose(z[2], x[1])

# Moreover, one can also perform message passing on multiple types at the same time, aggregating the results
g.multi_update_all({
    'follows': (fn.copy_u('x', 'm'), fn.sum('m', 'w')),
    'attracts': (fn.copy_u('a', 'm'), fn.sum('m', 'w')),
    }, 'sum')
```

Knowledge Graph Models
===

We also released DGL-KE, a subpackage of DGL that trains embeddings on knowledge graphs. This package is adapted from the [KnowledgeGraphEmbedding](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding) package. We made it fast and scalable while still maintaining the flexibility of the original package. Using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU, DGL-KE can train TransE on FB15k in **6.85 mins**, substantially outperforming existing tools such as GraphVite.  For graphs with hundreds of millions of edges (such as the full Freebase graph), it takes a couple of hours on **one** EC2 x1.32xlarge machine.

Currently, the following models are supported:

* TransE
* DistMult
* ComplEx

And the following training schemas are supported:

* CPU training
* GPU training
* Joint CPU & GPU training
* Multiprocessing training on CPUs

**Training results on FB15k using one NVIDIA V100 GPU**

Training Speed:

|  Models | TransE | DistMult | ComplEx |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
|MAX_STEPS| 20000  | 100000   | 100000  |
|TIME     | 411s   | 690s     | 806s    |

Training accuracy:

|  Models  |  MR   |  MRR  | HITS@1 | HITS@3 | HITS@10 |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| TransE   | 69.12 | 0.656 | 0.567  | 0.718  | 0.802   |
| DistMult | 43.35 | 0.783 | 0.713  | 0.837  | 0.897   |
| ComplEx  | 51.99 | 0.785 | 0.720  | 0.832  | 0.889   |

In comparison, GraphVite uses 4 GPUs and takes 14 minutes. Thus, DGL-KE trains TransE on FB15k 2x times faster than GraphVite while using much fewer resources.
