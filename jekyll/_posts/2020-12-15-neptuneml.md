AWS just announced the availability of [Neptune ML](http://aws.amazon.com/neptune/machine-learning/).
Amazon Neptune is a fast,
reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and
run applications that work with highly connected datasets. Neptune ML is a new
capability that uses graph neural networks (GNNs), a machine learning (ML)
technique purpose-built for graphs, for making easy, fast, and accurate
predictions on graphs. The accuracy of most predictions for graphs increases to
50% with Neptune ML when compared to non-graph methods. Neptune ML uses the
Deep Graph Library (DGL), an open-source library to which AWS contributes that
makes it easy to develop and apply GNN models on graph data. Now, developers
can create, train, and apply ML on Neptune data in hours instead of weeks
without the need to learn new tools and ML technologies.

We would love to see more commercial vendors build innovation on top of DGL in
the future. For more information about Neptune ML, please visit the [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/announcing-amazon-neptune-ml-easy-fast-and-accurate-predictions-on-graphs/)
and [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/machine-learning/). Watch the
[re:Invent 2020 Machine Learning Keynote](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/)
