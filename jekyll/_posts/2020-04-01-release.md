TensorFlow support
===

DGL finally comes to the TensorFlow community starting from this release.
Switching to TensorFlow is easy. If you are a first-time user, please install
DGL and `import dgl`, and then follow the instructions to set the default
backend. You can always switch back by changing the `config.json` file, which is
under `~/.dgl` folder. DGL keeps a coherent user experience regardless of which
backend is currently in use. The following code demonstrates the basic steps to
apply a graph convolution layer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import dgl.nn as dglnn

# Random features for 10 nodes; each is of length 5.
x = tf.random.normal((10, 5))
# Random graph; 10 nodes and 20 edges.
g = dgl.rand_graph(10, 20)
# Pre-defined graph convolution module.
conv = dglnn.GraphConv(5, 3)
y = conv(g, x)  # Apply the graph convolution layer.
```

We have implemented and released 15 common GNN modules in TensorFlow (more are
coming), all of which can be invoked in one line of codes.

* `GraphConv` from the [Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) paper.
* `GATConv` from the [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10903.pdf) paper.
* `SAGEConv` from the [Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf) paper (a.k.a. GraphSAGE).
* `GINConv` from the [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00826.pdf) paper.
* `RelGraphConv` from the [Modeling Relational Data with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06103) paper.
* `SGConv` from the [Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07153.pdf) paper.
* `APPNPConv` from the [Predict then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks meet Personalized PageRank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05997.pdf) paper.
* An `edge_softmax` function for computing softmax over the neighboring edges of each vertex.
* Various pooling layers: `SumPooling`, `AvgPooling`, `MaxPooling`, `SortPooling`, `WeightAndSum`, and `GlobalAttentionPooling`.
* A `HeteroGraphConv` module for applying GNN modules to heterogeneous graphs. 

Our preliminary benchmark shows strong performance improvement against other
TF-based tools for GNNs in terms of both training speed (measured by epoch
running time in seconds) and memory consumption.

DGL-KE: A light-speed package for learning knowledge graph embeddings
===
Previously incubated under the DGL main repository, DGL-KE now officially
announces its 0.1 release as a standalone package. The key highlights are:

* Effortlessly generate knowledge graph embedding with one line of code.
* Support for giant graphs with millions of nodes and edges.
* Distributed training with highly-optimized graph partitioning, negative
  sampling and communication, which can be deployed on both multi-GPU machines
  and multi-machine clusters.

DGL-KE can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install dglke
```

The following command trains embeddings of the full FreeBase graph (86M nodes
and 338M edges) with 8 GPUs.

```bash
dglke_train --model TransE_l2 --dataset Freebase --batch_size 1000 \
            --neg_sample_size 200 --hidden_dim 400 --gamma 10 --lr 0.1 \
            --regularization_coef 1e-9 -adv --gpu 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \
            --max_step 320000 --log_interval 10000 --async_update \
            --rel_part --force_sync_interval 10000
```

DGL-LifeSci: Bringing Graph Neural Networks to Chemistry and Biology
===

Previously incubated as a model zoo for chemistry, DGL-LifeSci is now spun off
as a standalone package. The key highlights are:

* Training scripts and pre-trained models for various applications â€” molecular
  property prediction, generative models, and reaction prediction.
* Up to 5.5x model training speedup compared to previous implementations.
* Well defined pipelines for data processing, model construction and
  evaluation.

DGL-LifeSci can be installed with pip or conda.

```bash
pip install dgllife
conda install -c dglteam dgllife
```

A summary of speedup in seconds per epoch of training:

| Model | Original Implementations | DGL-LifeSci Implementations | Speedup |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GCN on Tox21 | 5.5 (DeepChem) | 1 | 5.5x |
| AttentiveFP on Aromaticity | 6 | 1.2 | 5x |
| JTNN on ZINC | 1826 | 743 | 2.5x |
| WLN for reaction center prediction | 11657 | 5095 | 2.3x |

Experimenting new APIs for sampling
===

Sampling is crucial to training GNNs on giant graphs. In this release, we
re-design the APIs for sampling, aiming for a more intuitive programming
experience and a better performance at the same time. The new APIs have several
advantages:

* Support a wide range of sampling-based GNN models, including PinSAGE,
  GraphSAGE, Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GCMC), and etc.
* Support customization in Python.
* Support heterogeneous graphs.
* Leverage all pre-defined NN modules with no code change.
* Utilize both multi-processing and multi-threading for maximum speed.

The code below defines a basic neighbor sampler:

```python
class NeighborSampler(object):
    def __init__(self, g, fanouts):
        self.g = g  # The full graph structure
        self.fanouts = fanouts  # fan-out of each layer

    def sample_blocks(self, seeds):
        # `seeds` are the set of nodes to build one sample from.
        blocks = []
        for fanout in self.fanouts:
            # For each seed node, sample ``fanout`` neighbors.
            frontier = dgl.sampling.sample_neighbors(g, seeds, fanout, replace=True)
            # Then we compact the frontier into a bipartite graph for message passing.
            block = dgl.to_block(frontier, seeds)
            # Obtain the seed nodes for next layer.
            seeds = block.srcdata[dgl.NID]

            blocks.insert(0, block)
        return blocks
```

Although these APIs are still experimental, you can find their usages in many
examples:

* Train the GraphSAGE model by neighbor sampling and scale it to multiple GPUs
  ([link](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/graphsage)).
* Train the Relational GCN model on heterogeneous graphs by sampling for both
  node classification and link prediction ([link](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/rgcn-hetero)).
* Train the PinSAGE model by random walk sampling for item recommendation ([link](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/pull/1334)).
* Train the GCMC model by sampling for MovieLens rating prediction ([link](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/pull/1296)).
* Implement the variance reduction technique for neighbor sampling ([link](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/pull/1355)) proposed by [Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10568)

We will continue polishing these APIs, and the corresponding documentations and
tutorials are coming.

Other Improvements
===
* All GNN modules under `dgl.nn` now support both homogeneous graph and bipartite graph.
* `DGLHeteroGraph` now has a faster pickling/unpickling implementation.
* Add new APIs for saving and loading `DGLHeteroGraph` from checkpoints.
* `BatchedDGLGraph` and `DGLSubGraph` classes have been merged to `DGLGraph`.
* Constructing `DGLGraph` no longer requires a `multigraph` flag.
