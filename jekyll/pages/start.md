Using DGL with SageMaker
---

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables data scientists and
developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning
models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker now supports DGL, simplifying
implementation of DGL models. A Deep Learning container (MXNet 1.6 and PyTorch
1.3) bundles all the software dependencies and the SageMaker API automatically
sets up and scales the infrastructure required to train graphs. Please refer to
the [SageMaker documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deep-graph-libary.html) for
more information. The best way to get stated is with our sample Notebooks
below:

* Semi-supervised classification of a knowledge base using a GCN ([https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcn](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcn))
* Learning embeddings of large-scale knowledge graphs using a dataset of scientific publications ([https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_kge](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_kge))
* Molecular property prediction of toxicity using a GCN ([https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcn_tox21](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcn_tox21))
* Recommender system for movies using a GCMC implementation ([https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcmc](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/dgl_gcmc))
