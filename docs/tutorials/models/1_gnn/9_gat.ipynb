    "normalization constant based on graph structure, $\\sigma$ is an\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equation (1) is a linear transformation of the lower layer embedding $h_i^{(l)}$\n",
    "  and $W^{(l)}$ is its learnable weight matrix.\n",
    "* Equation (2) computes a pair-wise *un-normalized* attention score between two neighbors.\n",
    "  Here, it first concatenates the $z$ embeddings of the two nodes, where $||$\n",
    "  denotes concatenation, then takes a dot product of it and a learnable weight vector\n",
    "  $\\vec a^{(l)}$, and applies a LeakyReLU in the end. This form of attention is\n",
    "  usually called *additive attention*, contrast with the dot-product attention in the\n",
    "  Transformer model.\n",
    "* Equation (3) applies a softmax to normalize the attention scores on each node's\n",
    "  incoming edges.\n",
    "* Equation (4) is similar to GCN. The embeddings from neighbors are aggregated together,\n",
    "  scaled by the attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other details from the paper, such as dropout and skip connections.\n",
    "For the purpose of simplicity, those details are left out of this tutorial. To see more details,\n",
    "download the [full example](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/examples/pytorch/gat/gat.py).\n",
    "In its essence, GAT is just a different aggregation function with attention\n",
