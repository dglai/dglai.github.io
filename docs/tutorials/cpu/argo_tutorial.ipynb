    "# Improve Scalability on Multi-Core CPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Neural Network (GNN) training suffers from low scalability on multi-core CPUs. \n",
    "Specificially, the performance often caps at 16 cores, and no improvement is observed when applying more than 16 cores [#f1]_.\n",
    "ARGO is a runtime system that offers scalable performance.  \n",
    "With ARGO enabled, we are able to scale over 64 cores, allowing ARGO to speedup GNN training (in terms of epoch time) by up to 4.30x and 3.32x on a Xeon 8380H and a Xeon 6430L, respectively [#f2]_.\n",
    "This chapter focus on how to setup ARGO to unleash the potential of multi-core CPUs to speedup GNN training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "ARGO utilizes the scikit-optimize library for auto-tuning. Please install scikit-optimize to run ARGO:\n",
    ".. code-block:: shell\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge \"scikit-optimize>=0.9.0\" \n",
    "or\n",
    ".. code-block:: shell\n",
    "    pip install scikit-optimize>=0.9\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enabling ARGO on your own GNN program\n",
    "In this section, we provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to enable ARGO on a DGL program. \n",
    "We use the *ogb_example.py* [#f3]_ as an example.\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>We also provide the complete example file *ogb_example_ARGO.py* [#f4]_ \n",
    "    which followed the steps below to enable ARGO on *ogb_example.py*.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "First, include all necessary packages on top of the file. Please place your file and *argo.py* [#f5]_ in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    import torch.distributed as dist\n",
    "    from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel\n",
    "    import torch.multiprocessing as mp\n",
    "    from argo import ARGO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "Setup PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1. Add the initialization function on top of the training program, and wrap the ```model``` with the DDP wrapper\n",
    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "    def train(...):\n",
    "        dist.init_process_group('gloo', rank=rank, world_size=world_size) # newly added\n",
    "        model = SAGE(...) # original code\n",
    "        model = DistributedDataParallel(model) # newly added\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "     \n",
    "2.2. In the main program, add the following before launching the training function\n",
    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = '127.0.0.1'\n",
    "    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '29501'\n",
    "    mp.set_start_method('fork', force=True)\n",
    "    train(args, device, data) # original code for launching the training function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "Enable ARGO by initializing the runtime system, and wrapping the training function\n",
    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "    runtime = ARGO(n_search = 15, epoch = args.num_epochs, batch_size = args.batch_size) # initialization\n",
    "    runtime.run(train, args=(args, device, data)) # wrap the training function\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>ARGO takes three input parameters: number of searches *n_search*, number of epochs, and the mini-batch size. \n",
    "    Increasing *n_search* potentially leads to a better configuration with less epoch time; \n",
    "    however, searching itself also causes extra overhead. We recommend setting *n_search* from 15 to 45 for an optimal overall performance.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4\n",
    "Modify the input of the training function, by directly adding ARGO parameters after the original inputs.\n",

    "This is the original function:\n",
    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "   def train(args, device, data):\n",
    "   \n",

    ".. code-block:: python\n",
    "    def train(args, device, data, rank, world_size, comp_core, load_core, counter, b_size, ep):\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 6\n",
    "Enable core-binding by adding *enable_cpu_affinity()* before the training for-loop, and also change the number of epochs into the variable *ep*: \n",
